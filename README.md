 What follows is a command line interface (CLI)
 blackjack app.  But this is no ordinary blackjack
 game.  In this blackjack game, there are Two types
 of PLAYERS : the DEALER, and the SELF.

 A DEALER operates upon certain principles, which
 have been defined to be deterministic, while the SELF,
 With Whom you Indentify for the Duration of the Game,
 operates with Personal Choice within certain
 Constraints.

 More than a game, this app is a poem, philosophical
 instigator, or meditation guide, something that built
 itself from my efforts to learn to play the text
 editor VIM, which has required me to Take One Step
 At A Time.

 Throughout game play, there will be messages that
 are transmitted 'from the machine' to the player.

 For example, if you lose three hands in a row, a
 product of pure carelessness, the 'machine' tells
 you to quit playing the game and go on a walk instead.
 The way you can win the game is by typing 'quit' and
 hitting 'enter'. Then the 'machine' congratulates you
 for having won the game!

 The code is by no means finished. There are many game
 features lacking. Future goals include, however,

      - Multiple rounds of game play with a Score
      - ASCII art playing cards
          and
      - Animated game play, using the
          while (true)
          {
            processInput();
            update();
            render();
          }
        game loop paradigm.

 Other funny features could include betting - which
 to code isn't that difficult, but philosophically
 can be QUITE THE UNDERTAKING - and a high scores
 bracket that lists all the times you've quit the game -
 that is, 'won'.
